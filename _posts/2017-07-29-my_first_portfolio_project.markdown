Though I am a little late to the blog game, I titled my blog "More Than Passing Tests" because that's what I want my learning experience at flatiron to be about. As I have now completed my first portfolio project -- a program that pulls data from the Boston Public Library website (bpl.org) -- and am getting ready to submit it for review, I have been reflecting about the difficulty of this assignment and how beneficial it was for me to complete.

Throughout my educational life, I have been good at passing tests. I quickly understand a process or what is wrong and plug in the correct formula to arrive at the right answer or correct a mistake. My approach to coding in the online development program at flatiron has been no different; I have blazed through tons of labs by quickly correcting my code to pass tests without taking the time to process and understand what I am really doing. Although I have been "progressing", one can see how this could make things challenging once I need to write my own programs. 

Since arriving at the CLI project, this issue has definitely reared its ugly head! Conceptually, I knew very quickly where I wanted to go regarding this project and the structure I wanted to have, but because I had just been passing tests rather than trying to holistically understand the material, I had a much harder time with this project than I needed to. This project has not only helped me better understand how larger chunks of code work together and increased my attention to detail/bug resoution skills but also challenged me to change my framework from which I operate and attitude towards learning how to code -- all while pushing me to create a program that I am proud of!

Thanks Flatiron Team!
