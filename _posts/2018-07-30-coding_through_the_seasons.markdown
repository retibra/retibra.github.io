Before starting flatiron school, I was approaching my 7th year at GE. It had been a wild ride across six different manufacturing shops, four states,  and eight different roles. Those experiences taught me a ton, and I am a much more empathetic, knowledgeable, and cultured person as a result of having them. However, after many years of supply chain and subsequently application implementation experience, the opportunities for me to exercise the technical side of my brain (I'm an engineer) began to dwindle. I became a bit frustrated -- I wanted and needed an outlet, and it was for this reason I began to search out options in which I could pursue something more technical.

After poking around many channels, I remembered a conversation with one my brother's (a developer) colleagues who had been through and had a high recommendation of flatiron school. Upon visiting the flatiron website, I discovered  the free trial for basic ruby and javascript and promptly began devouring content and conquering labs! From there it was an easy decision to pursue software development more seriously and possibly as a career option as it satiated my need to work in something technical.

Since this initial and wonderful foray into the coding world, however, my priorities have shifted a bit. Through a series of life changing events, I have become a father, changed jobs, and moved from Boston to Austin. As such, coding got put on the back burner for many moons, but I am now back in the saddle and have continued my learning! My hope is that I can graduate from the online developer program within the next 6 months, and even though a career as a developer may not be in my future, I am excited and motivated because I know how valuable these skills will be to my toolkit.
